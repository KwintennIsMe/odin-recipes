        <li>Pumpkin Puree: This simple pumpkin pie recipe calls for a 16-ounce can of pumpkin puree. Of course, you can puree your own pumpkin if you want to go the homemade route.</li>
        <li>Sweetened Condensed Milk: A can of sweetened condensed milk adds irresistible flavor and creates a rich, smooth texture.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix: Combine the pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl. Mix until smooth, then pour into the prepared pie crust.</li>
        <li> Bake: Bake in an oven preheated to 425 degrees F for about 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue baking until the filling is set.</li>
